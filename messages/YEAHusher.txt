Up in the club with my homies
Tryna get a little V-I
Keep it down on the low-key (low-key)
'Cause you know how it feels (hey, hey)
I saw this shorty, she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' in my ear
You would think that she know me (know me)
I decided to chill (okay)

Conversation got heavy (hey)
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow (watch out)
Oh (watch out), ooh
She was sayin': Come get me (come get me)
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said: Baby, let's go

Yeah, yeah, yeah (wha'? Wha'?)

So she's all up in my head now
Got me thinkin' that it might be a good idea to take her with me (with me)
'Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leave now) (oh, let's go)
But I gotta keep it real now (yeah)
'Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me, hey

'Cause I don't know
If I take that chance, just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know
Is the way she dance, make shorty alright with me (hey, hey, hey)
The way she get low
I'm like: Yeah, just work that out for me
She asked for one more dance and I'm like: Yeah

In the club, lookin' so conspicuous
And, rawr, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (yeah)
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (what?)
I won't stop till I get 'em in their birthday suit (yeah)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes, I
Left the Jag' and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cuttin', then I put 'em on foot patrol (let's go), ow
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand?
Let's drink, you the one to please (yeah)
Ludacris fill cups like double Ds (yeah)
Me and Ursh once more and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed that say
