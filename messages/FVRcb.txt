1, 2, 3, 4

It's you and me
Moving at the speed of light
Into eternity

Tonight is the night to join me
In the middle of ecstasy
Feel the melody in the rhythm
Of the music around you, around you

I'm gonna take you there
I'm gonna take you there
So don't be scared
I'm right here, baby

We can go anywhere, go anywhere
But first it's your chance
Take my hand come with me

It's like I've waited my whole life
For this one night
It's gonna be me you and the dance floor

Cause we've only got one night
Double your pleasure
Double your fun

And dance
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)

Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever on the dance floor

Feels like we're on another level
Feels like our loves intertwined
We can be two rebels
Breaking the rules
Me and you, you and I

All you got to do is watch me
Look what I can do with my feet
Baby, feel the beat tight
I'm driving you can take the front seat
Just need you to trust me

Oh, oh, oh
It's like

It's like I've waited my whole life
For this one night
It's gonna be me you and the dance floor

Cause we've only got one night
Double your pleasure
Double your fun

And dance
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)

Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever on the dance floor

It's a long way down
We're so high off the ground
Sending for an angel to bring me your heart

Girl, where did you come from?
Got me so undone
Gazing in your eyes got me singing
What a beautiful lady
No if's, and's or maybe's
I'm releasing my heart and it's feeling amazing

There's no one else that matters
You love me and I won't let you fall girl
Let you fall girl

Oh, oh, oh, yeah
I won't let you fall
Let you fall
Let you fall

Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

It's like

It's like I've waited my whole life
For this one night
It's gonna be me you and the dance floor

Cause we've only got one night
Double your pleasure
Double your fun

And dance
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)

Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever (ever, ever)
Forever on the dance floor

Oh, oh, oh
Forever (ever, ever)
